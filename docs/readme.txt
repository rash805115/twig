Twig
====

Twig is a desktop software which implements python.bookeeping.frontend. BooKeeping is the underlying project with many moving parts.
Twig software is the frontend for that.

Twig is a file versioning system which works the same way as you would expect other code versioning systems to work (like github, p4v, etc.).
However twig differs in many facets too. For starters, its not just for codes, but is for all types of files and is intended to be able to diff all file types.
